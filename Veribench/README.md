# Installation

The installation is managed by `uv`. All the agent script that interfaces with `PyPantograph` needs to be run under this environment.

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

Then activate the uv environment under this current folder:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
