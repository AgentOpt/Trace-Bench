# Embedded evaluation code (benchmark)
# Module Name: QAPEvaluation
# Last Revision: 2025/2/16
# Description: Evaluates the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).
#       The QAP involves assigning a set of facilities to a set of locations in such a way that the total cost of interactions between facilities is minimized.
#       This module is part of the LLM4AD project (https://github.com/Optima-CityU/llm4ad).
#
# Parameters:
#   - timeout_seconds: Maximum allowed time (in seconds) for the evaluation process: int (default: 20).
#   - n_facilities: Number of facilities to assign: int (default: 50).
#   - n_instance: Number of problem instances to generate: int (default: 10).
